Revision history for Perl extension Exception::ThrowUnless

1.01:
	initial revision

1.02:
	fixed test problem:  expected an EPERM, didn't get it when
		run as root.

1.03:
	fixed Makefiles, they were too ambitious

1.04:
	silly bug in schdir:  it was trying to pass an array to chdir, resulting
	in chdir("1") system calls.  Made it work.

	Also added some tests, still more to be done!

1.10:
	added ssocketpair, srmdir, ssuck, and sspit.  ssuck and sspit are more
	'whole file' kind of things than thin wrappers around normal system calls,
	but I find it handy to use them in cases where I want to write terse code,
	so I included them.

	ssuck will, for a list of files, return the contents of the files, or
	die if it is unable to open them.

	sspit will, for a file name and a list of lines, create the file and
	put the lines therein.

	added some tests.
